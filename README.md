# Simple-Organism-Movement
I have built a Python simulation model that represents two species of organisms randomly distributed in a neighborhood. Each organism has a preference for being surrounded by organisms of the same species and will move to another location in the neighborhood if too many of its immediate neighbors are of the opposite species. The neighborhood is represented by a square grid of cells, and the organisms prefer to be surrounded by organisms of the same type. The simulation models the organisms' movement and relocation until all of them are satisfied with their location. Based on the proportion of like neighbors that an organism needs to be satisfied, the simulation model shows that the distribution settles down to a stable pattern with the species segregated into distinct regions for certain values of this proportion.
